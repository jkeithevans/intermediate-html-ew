## What are the four CSS math functions we covered above?
calc(), min(), max(), and clamp().

## How do we use CSS math functions in our CSS?
You use them just like you would in JavaScript. The functions are passed “arguments” between parentheses, each of which is used by the function in a specific way.

## How can CSS functions help make websites and applications more responsive?
It can help make it more responsive by using a combination of vh, vw, rem, em, and px. You can use vh for the div, then if you have a header and footer, can use the calc() method to adjust the height of the div between the header and footer automatically.
